"""
This file contains helpers that allow us to reason about "scoped setups"

A scoped setup is a setup and all associated operations needed to calculate its values. It can be
thought of as the sequence of operations needed to set up the accelerator. Given the following IR:

```
func.func public @simple_mult(%arg0 : memref<?xi32>, %arg1 : memref<?xi32>, %arg2 : memref<?xi32>) {
  %0 = arith.constant 0 : index
  %cst_0 = arith.constant 0 : i5
  %1 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg0) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
  %2 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg1) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
  %3 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg2) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
  %4 = "memref.dim"(%arg0, %0) : (memref<?xi32>, index) -> index

  %5 = accfg.setup "snax_hwpe_mult" to ("A" = %1 : index, "B" = %2 : index, "O" = %3 : index, "size" = %4 : index) : ...

  // ...
```

The scoped setup of %5 would be:
```
ScopedSetupWithInputs(
    setup = %5 = accfg.setup ...
    dependent_vars = tuple(%arg0, %arg1, %arg2)
    inputs = (
        %0 = arith.constant 0 : index
        %1 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg0) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
        %2 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg1) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
        %3 = "memref.extract_aligned_pointer_as_index"(%arg2) : (memref<?xi32>) -> index
        %4 = "memref.dim"(%arg0, %0) : (memref<?xi32>, index) -> index
    )
)
```

With `%cst_0` being absent, as it's not used as part of the setup sequence.

Some further restrictions:

- A scoped setup is always scoped to within a block, no operations outside that block are considered.
- A scoped setup may only contain operations that are side effect free, as we only care to argue about
  setup sequences that we can move around or copy.

A scoped setup can be:

- Moved a bit (see `lazy_move_up` for more details)
