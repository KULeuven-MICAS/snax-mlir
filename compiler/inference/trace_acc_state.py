"""
This inference helpers are used to figure out which values are
present at which points in the IR.

Example inference results:

```
acc.setup(A = %1, B = %2)  // previous state = {}
// ...
acc.setup(A = %3, C = %1)  // previous state = {A = %1, B = %2}
```

These inference passes walk the IR backwards.
