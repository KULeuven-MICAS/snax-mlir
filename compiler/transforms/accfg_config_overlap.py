    Converts an `scf.for` loop to have setup/launch overlaps

    Given the following IR:
    ```
     %s0 = setup ... // loop-initial state
     scf.for (%i = %lb to %ub step %step) iter_args(%l0 = %s0) ... {
       %l1 = setup from %l0 to ("i" = %i)
       %t = launch(%l1)
       await(%t)
       yield %l1
     }
    ```

    1. We grab the first setup op inside the loop, with all dependencies
    2. We insert a copy of the setup op before the loop, replacing dependencies with the loop inputs (%lb)
    3. We insert a copy of the setup af the end of the loop, replacing dependencies with the next iterations variables
       (which we get from the yield / by adding %step to %i)
    4. We erase the original setup op.


    This results in the following IR post-optimization:

    ```
     %s0 = setup ... // loop-initial state
     %l1 = setup from %s0 to ("i" = %lb)
     scf.for (%i = %lb to %ub step %step) iter_args(%l0 = %s0) ... {

       %l1 = setup from %l0 to ("i" = %i_next)
       yield %l1
     }
    ```
    The setup will then be lifted before the await by the BlockLevelSetupAwaitOverlapPattern.

    This will result in an additional setup that is unused (in the last iteration of the loop), but seeing as this
    is happening during an await anyway, we won't focus much in it for now.
